# River Flow API

This is a passion project for working with raw river flow data and enabling ML learning opportunities. The data will be used for various purposes such as:
- River Flow Alerts for rafting, kayaking and/or fishing
- Raw data to be combined with various other forms of data such as weather, air quality and snowpack for Machine Learning and river flow predictions
